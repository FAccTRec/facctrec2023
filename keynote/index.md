# Abstract
Abstract: Fair machine learning aims to build machine learning models such that the predicted decisions made are not subject to discrimination and satisfy fairness requirements. Current fair machine learning literature is mainly focused on static settings where one-shot decisions are made. However, in practical situations, decision-making is more of a sequential nature where each decision may have an impact on subsequent decisions. In this talk, I will discuss the application of Pearl's Structural Causal Model (SCM) as a general framework and a prime methodology for the study of fair sequential decision-making. I will present results on three situations in sequential decision-making: (1) multiple related decision models at different stages are learned in a partial order; (2) a single decision model is executed repeatedly and could reshape environments through feedback loops; and (3) online recommendation where customers arrive in a sequential and stochastic manner.
